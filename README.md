# Matrix Trivia 

* Trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the `correct` answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed without user input (or the user can choose to skip the time interval).

* The scenario is similar for `wrong answers` and `time-outs`.

  * `Time-out:` If the player runs out of time, the player is told that time's up and shown the correct answer. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed without user input (or the user can choose to skip the time interval).
  * `Incorrect:` If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is told they selected the wrong option and shown the correct answer. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed without user input (or the user can choose to skip the time interval).

* On the final screen, the user is shown the number of `correct` answers, `incorrect` answers, `un-answered` questions and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
